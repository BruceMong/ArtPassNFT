# Project Overview

This is a DApp (Decentralized Application) focused on NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) based around art pieces. The core idea is for an art gallery (the owner of the contract) to create NFTs linked to physical artworks. These art pieces will have QR codes attached to them. When visitors scan these QR codes, they can acquire the artwork's NFT from the owner.

Initially, I had planned to create a secondary NFT as proof of viewing, which would be a non-transferable NFT containing the date the artwork was transferred. However, the immutability and traceability properties of blockchain technology make this secondary smart contract unnecessary. The transaction history inherently provides a transparent and tamper-proof record of ownership and transfers.

Despite this, implementing multiple smart contracts was an interesting and valuable learning experience for me, allowing me to explore interactions between different contracts within the blockchain ecosystem.
